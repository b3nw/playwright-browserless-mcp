## Troubleshooting

### Server not appearing in `/mcp`
1. Restart your AI assistant completely
2. Verify the server works: `npx playwright-browserless-mcp --help`
3. Check the configuration syntax in your config file

### Connection errors
1. Verify your browserless instance is running
2. Test the WebSocket URL in a browser
3. Check firewall/network settings

### Tool naming issues
If you see old tool names (navigate, screenshot, etc.), you're using an outdated version. Update to v1.1.0:
```bash
npx playwright-browserless-mcp@latest --url your-browserless-url
```

### Version compatibility
This server works with Playwright v1.53. If your browserless instance uses a different version, you may need to adjust the playwright dependency.
